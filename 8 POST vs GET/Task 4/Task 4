# Assignment: Dynamic Movie Catalog with Detailed Information Page

## Objective
In this assignment, you will create a dynamic web application that displays a list of movies from a MySQL database. Each movie in the list should be clickable, leading to a detailed page that shows more information about the selected movie.

## Instructions

### MySQL
#### Set Up the Database:
1. Create a MySQL database named `movies`.

### PHP
#### Movie Listing Page (`all_movies.php`):
1. Develop a PHP page (`all_movies.php`) that connects to the `movies` table.
2. Retrieve and display all movies from the `movies` table in a list format.
3. Each movie title should be a clickable link that directs the user to a `movie_details.php` page, passing the movie's `id` in the URL (e.g., `movie_details.php?id=1`).

#### Movie Details Page (`movie_details.php`):
1. Develop a PHP page (`movie_details.php`) that retrieves and displays detailed information about a movie based on the `id` passed in the URL.
2. Display the movieâ€™s title, description, release year, and genre.

### HTML/CSS
1. Use responsive design principles, implementing a grid system to ensure your pages look good on different screen sizes.
